# TA Assessment Nomster

Nomster is a challenging project.  The following is a broken application with many of the same problems students face when building the application on their own.

## Known Issues

* Visiting the page to view a place throws an error
* New places can't be created

Also the student would be in the process of trying to make it possible to create photos in the database, but unsure of how to fix their application.

*Keep in mind*: while the student has tried their best, their app will not work.  Students will also not always tell you the truth (they may be mis-remembering the order of the steps they did or tell you they've made changes that they in fact haven't).
